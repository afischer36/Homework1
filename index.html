<h2>About:</h2>
<div><p>I am a senior at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business. I was born in Waukesha, WI and 
when I was 7 years old my family moved to Iowa City. I went to City High up the street and graduated in '08. After that I started taking classes
at the University, and have been here since. 

I have changed majors a few times, from dentistry to pharmacy  to education to marketing and now finally to MIS. I definitely think that I have found my passion 
with MIS and have enjoyed all the classes I've taken so far. 
<br></br>
My free time includes hanging out with my fiance and getting our wedding planned out. We set the wedding day to be August 10th, 2013 in Bettendorf, IA. 

Other than school my life consists of sports. I am a huge Packers, Brewers, and Badgers fan and will gladly debate why these three teams are best best in their 
respective sport (I'm not really that naive). 

This next May I will be graduating and looking for a full-time position. I'd like to stay in the midwest becuase 1. They brew the best beer here and 2. I love all things 
outdoors whether it be fishing, boating, hiking, or building an igloo. 

So that is a little bit about myself, below are some pictures of my fiance and me, and also some friends and me.  </p></div>
